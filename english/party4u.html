<pre id="lyrics" style="text-align:center;">

I only threw this party for you
Only threw this party for you, for you, for you
I was hopin' you would come through
I was hopin' you would come through, it's true, it's true
Only threw this party for you
I only threw this party for you, for you, for you
I'm about to party on you
Watch me, watch me party on you, yeah
<br>
One thousand pink balloons
Dj with your favorite tunes
Birthday cake in August
But you were born nineteenth of June
Champagne pourin' in your mouth
Called your friends from out of town
Got the party bag with the purple pills
And I'm waiting for you by the window, yeah
Called your digits, but the phone kept ringin'
Wish I knew what you were thinking
Na-na, na, one thousand pink balloons
Dancin' on to your favorite tunes
Hope you walk in the party
'Cause I threw the party just for you, like oh
<br>
I only threw this party for you
Only threw this party for you, for you, for you
I was hopin' you would come through
I was hopin' you would come through, it's true, it's true
Only threw this party for you
I only threw this party for you, for you, for you
I'm about to party on you
Watch me, watch me party on you, yeah
<br>
You could watch me pull up on your body
Like it's summer, take my clothes off in the water
Splash around and get you blessed like holy water
I don't know what you were waiting for
You know that I've been waiting for you
(I only threw this party for you)
Yeah, if you saw my tears, would you touch me?
Kiss me on the mouth, say you love me?
Leave a message, tell me you're sorry?
Hit me right back, hit me right back
Why you treating me like someone that you never loved?<br>
I only threw this party for you
Only threw this party for you, for you, for you
I was hopin' you would come through
I was hopin' you would come through, it's true, it's true
Only threw this party for you
I only threw this party for you, for you, for you
I'm about to party on you
Watch me, watch me party on you, yeah
<br>
I only threw this party for you
Only threw this party for you, for you, for you
I was hopin' you would come through
I was hopin' you would come through, it's true, it's true
Only threw this party for you
I only threw this party for you, for you, for you
I'm about to party on you
Watch me, watch me party on you, yeah
<br>
Party on you, party on you
Party on-party on you, party on you
Party on-party on you, party on you
Party on-party on you, party on you
Party on-party on you, party on you
Party on-party on you, party on you
Party on-party on you, party on you
Party on-party on you, party on you
Party on-party on you, party on you
Party on-party on you, party on you
Party on-party on you, party on you
Party on-party on you, party on you
<br>
Come to my party (party on-party on you, party on you)
(Party on-party on you, party on you)
Come to my party (party on-party on you, party on you)
(Party on-party on you, party on you)
<br>
All I'm thinking, all I know is (party on-party on you, party on you)
That I hope you knock on my door (party on-party on you, party on you)
Nervous energy (party on-party on you, party on you)
My heart rate rises higher, higher up (party on-party on you, party on you)
I wish you'd get here, kiss my face (party on-party on you, party on you)
Instead you're somewhere far away (party on-party on you, party on you)
My nervous energy will stay (party on-party on you, party on you)
I hope you realize one day, uh (party on-party on you, party on you)
<br>
Come to my party (party on-party on you, party on you)
(Party on-party on you, party on you)
Come to my party (party on-party on you, party on you)
(Party on-party on you, party on you)
(Party on-party on you, party on you)
(Party on-party on you, party on you)
(Party on-party on you, party on you)
(Party on-party on you, party on you)
